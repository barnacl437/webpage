   <h1> >>blog thing(?)</h1>
   <p>:a page for everything testing. Some articles might be below.<br>
   <br>note: this blog page is under an update. the articles below the dashes are "legacy" articles and navigation links may be broken. still working on them...</P>
<p>note2: I have a Substack page and I feel that I'd start writing there as my primary blogging activity.
  I recommend switching (<a href="https://barnacl437.substack.com">here</a>) as I don't usually maintain my blogs from scratch.
  <br>
  note3: i plan to resurrect my old blog (which is here). expect something in the next time.
